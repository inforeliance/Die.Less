### MedCheck Project Retrospective
<pre>
At the end of each of the 4 MedCheck Project Sprints, we conducted a sprint retrospective meeting to help us understand what went well and where we could improve moving forward.  Notes from our retrospective meetings are as follows:

	•	**What went well?**
		o	The team ramped up quickly and was enthusiastic about getting started.
		o	There were no ‘slackers’ and each member went above and beyond their assigned tasks.
		o	The team challenged each other, provided constructive feedback and communicated effectively and often.
		o	The team was very creative in their approach and ultimately provided a final product that would add value to many people. 
	•	**What went wrong?**
		o	There was some lag time between discussing user story updates, tasks and assignments and seeing these updates reflected in Agilefant (the sprint planning tool).
		o	Due to availability, many team members worked odd/late hours.  This sometimes impacted tasks where there were dependencies leading to the dependent team member having to work odd hours.
		o	There were some inaccuracies with estimating use story points since some of the technologies used were new to some team members. 
	•	**What to fix?**
		o	Ensure updates to user stories are reflected immediately following sprint planning and backlog grooming sessions.
		o	If delays in tasks are expected, communicate with the person responsible for the dependent tasks so that scheduling can be worked out ahead of time.
		o	Use the sprint planning meeting to really understand the acceptance criteria of the user stories and update user story points accordingly.
