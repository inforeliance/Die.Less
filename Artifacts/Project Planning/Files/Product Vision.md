For many Americans understanding the interaction of drugs on factors like allergies, pregnancy and age can be a matter of life or death. The vision of the MedCheck prototype is to enable users to confirm if FDA approved drugs are safe for you to take.  This prototype will allow users to enter the drug name or scan the drug barcode that you want to check, input your allergens, age, and/or pregnancy status and you will see your personalized results.
