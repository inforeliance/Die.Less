**Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester**
<br>
Our Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Testerâ€™s (Designer) expertise consist of
determining target audiences and objectives, analyzing user and business needs, and setting
the scope and interface strategies. From personas and scenarios, storyboards, wireframes and
comps to creating functional prototypes to facilitate development, the Designer works directly
with the client through the entire life cycle of a project. The Designer is focused on helping
stakeholders realize solutions to their internal needs, while designing an ideal and intuitive
experience for the public.

The MedCheck Designer, used an analysis of the objectives and knowledge of the target
audience to create the user interface designs. The Designer identified and interviewed potential
users and created specific personas for each type. The Designer iteratively built out the site
concept and wireframes by soliciting feedback from the team through co-creation and
brainstorming sessions, roleplaying, and rapid-prototyping. From this point the Designer
created a branding style guide, designed the MedCheck website comps, worked with the
developers from beginning to end, and performed usability tests to ensure that the vision was
fulfilled.

BWD was responsible for developing the document database and RESTful web APIs to service
front-end requests. Once complete with backend development, the BWD merged in with the
remaining front-end development team to ensure factory services were optimized and securely
communicating with the MedCheck RESTful API.
