# Approach Criteria Evidence

### Full Stack Pool
No. | Criteria | Evidence 
--- | --- | ---
1 | assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted | The Product Manager (PM) had full authority, was responsible for delivering the prototype, established prototype goals, and translated them into user stories for the project backlog. The PM also obtained the project resources.
2 | assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team including a minimum of 5 labor categories from the Development Pool labor categories to design and develop the prototype | [6 Multidiscipline Individuals](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Project%20Planning/Files/6%20Multidiscipline%20Individuals.md)
3 | understand what people need, by including people in the prototype development and design process | We assigned collegues (not on the project) to represent target audience groups. We included these 3 core users in the prototype development and design process by collecting feedback and interviews. Supporting eveidence links:  [Users](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#users), 
[Feedback](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#user-feedback), 
[Interviews](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#interviews)
4 | used at least three "human-centered design" techniques or tools | MedCheck used the following tools for this criteria: MedCheck used the following tools for this criteria: [User Interviews](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#interviews), [User Personas](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#user-personas), [Co-creation Session](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#co-creation-brainstorming-roleplaying-rapid-prototyping), [Wireframe Prototypes](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#axure-wire-frames)
5 | created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library | The creative team provided the frontend development team landing, sub-page and a style-guide sheet to reference for developing the MedCheck interfaces.  The developers spliced the comps into responsive design interfaces leveraged Bower as the front-end dependency manager to leverage such packages as Bootstrap UI, Font Awesome and Toastr to deliver the final response and design of the vision style. 
6 | performed usability tests with people | Our Response
7 | used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype | During the development sprints, MedCheck leveraged GitHub to capture, respond and track issues and new features to the system.  On a daily basis the development team reacted to tester input to rapidly make UI adjustment, which enhanced the overall user experience.<br><br>MedCheck continues to support this process by providing users information on the App Feedback page, to submit feedback and suggestions to improve the system.
8 | created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design | Leveraging grid systems in Bootstrap UI, MedCheck was developed with responsive design and does not depreciate form or function when viewed through fragmentation of mobile devices and standard web browsers.
9 | used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.) | You may find the full list of MedCheck’s Open-source technologies in the [SOFTWARE.txt](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/SOFTWARE.txt)
10 | deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used | MedCheck is deployed to a IaaS utilizing AWS (Amazon Web Services).  The overarching IaaS architecture includes a Test and Production tier, each running an EC2 instance of Ubuntu Server on an Elastic Load Balancer which provides access to the Test and Dev environments.  AWS Code Deploy Services is also leveraged to accept latest commits from GitHub:  [Test](http://elb-medcheck-test-547267783.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com) and [Production](http://elb-medcheck-2043620629.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com)
11 | wrote unit tests for their code | Our Response
12 | set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider | MedCheck’s code deploy and testing to a PaaS is completely automated, simply invoked after each commit is pushed to GitHub by a developer. GitHub triggers our YAML script, which pushes the source to AWS Code Deploy Services where the code is routed and staged on an EC2 instance for testing using Jasmine and Karma.  Once testing passes, the source is built and moved to production.  The overall process takes less than 54 seconds to complete.
13 | set up or used configuration management | Our Response
14 | set up or used continuous monitoring | AWS Elastic Load Balancers are configured for continues monitor for both the Test and Production environments.  Each ELB monitors the health of the EC2 instances and fault reports are triggered to the administrator in the event a fault is detected.
15 | deploy their software in a container (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization) | Our Response
16 | make use of a API, by either consuming or providing one RESTfully. | FDA Drug Label API is used to drive the primary search feature of MedCheck, API calls can be found in [openfda.js](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Source/client/app/openfda/openfda.js) 
17 | used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype | Our Response
18 | provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine | Development container instructions [Development Environment Container Deployment](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Development/Development.md#development-environment-container-deployment) 
19 | prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge | Comprehensive FREE software list [SOFTWARE.txt](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/SOFTWARE.txt)
