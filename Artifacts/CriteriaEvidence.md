# Approach Criteria Evidence

### Full Stack Pool
No. | Criteria | Evidence 
--- | --- | ---
a | assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted | The Product Manager (PM) had full authority, was responsible for delivering the prototype, established prototype goals, and translated them into user stories for the project backlog. The PM also obtained the project resources.
b | assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team including a minimum of 5 labor categories from the Development Pool labor categories to design and develop the prototype | [6 Multidiscipline Individuals](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Project%20Planning/Files/6%20Multidiscipline%20Individuals.md)
c | understand what people need, by including people in the prototype development and design process | We assigned collegues (not on the project) to represent target audience groups. We included these 3 core users in the prototype development and design process by collecting feedback and interviews. Supporting eveidence links:  [Users](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#users), [Feedback](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#user-feedback), [Interviews](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#interviews)
d | used at least three "human-centered design" techniques or tools | InfoReliance used the following techniques and tools for this criteria: User Interviews, User Personas, Co-creation Session, Wireframe Links: [Interviews](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#interviews), [User Personas](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#user-personas), [co-creation-brainstorming-roleplaying-rapid-prototyping](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#co-creation-brainstorming-roleplaying-rapid-prototyping), [Axure Wireframes](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Design/Design.md#axure-wire-frames) 
e | created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library | The creative team provided the frontend development team landing, sub-page and a style-guide sheet to reference for developing the MedCheck interfaces. The developers spliced the comps into responsive design interfaces leveraged Bower as the front-end dependency manager to leverage such packages as Bootstrap UI, Font Awesome and Toastr to deliver the final response and design of the vision style.
f | performed usability tests with people | Usability testing was conducted throughout each sprint by our core user groups. The results of this testing was then provided to our team to evaluate, consolidate into the backlog and implement any changes in the subsequent sprint. [Testing](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Artifacts/Testing/Testing.md)    
g | used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype | On a daily basis the team reviewed the backlog and addressed test defects/recommendations which once approved, were entered into the sprint. MedCheck continues to support this process by providing users information on the App Feedback page, to submit feedback and suggestions to improve the system.
h | created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design | Leveraging grid systems in Bootstrap UI, MedCheck was developed with responsive design and does not depreciate form or function when viewed through fragmentation of mobile devices and standard web browsers.
i | used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.) | You may find the full list of MedCheckâ€™s Open-source technologies in the [SOFTWARE.txt](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/SOFTWARE.txt). 
j | deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used | MedCheck is deployed to a IaaS utilizing AWS (Amazon Web Services). The overarching IaaS architecture includes a Test and Production tier, each running an EC2 instance of Ubuntu Server on an Elastic Load Balancer which provides access to the Test and Dev environments. AWS Code Deploy Services is also leveraged to accept latest commits from GitHub.
k | wrote unit tests for their code | Front end and backend unit tests were written. See, for example: [main.controller.spec.js](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Source/client/app/main/main.controller.spec.js) and [user.model.spec.js](https://github.com/inforeliance/MedCheck/blob/master/Source/server/api/user/user.model.spec.js).
